<h2 id="future" align="left">Thinking Forward üí°</h2>
Since this is a POC built for a college subject certain things were prioritized over other (there were specific milestones with activities which should be developed and released every 2 weeks during the semester, just like in an actual company), so there are stuff I would like to keep developing and improving as well. Here are a few of them:
    
 - Complete user CRUD;
 - Show teaser of the recommendation;
 - Like/dislike an indication (feedback for the next indications);
 - Usage of AIs to improve the indication based on the user's preferences.

<h2 id="concl" align="left">Conclusion ‚úÖ</h2>
The <u><b>PickMe</b></u> is a simple but powerful tool to save you time when you just want to rest an chill watching something.

The technologies employed allow the app to have great performance on the most variable devices, as well as open up space to develop new features. <u><b>PickMe</b></u> ensures you won¬¥t waste time choosing what you will watch, so you an definetly chill while you watch something you actualy enjoy.
